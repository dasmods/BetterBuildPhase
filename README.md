# BetterBuildPhase

This is a PlateUp! plugin using [Aragami-delp/PlateUpModTemplate](https://github.com/Aragami-delp/PlateUpModTemplate).

This mod allows the player to toggle "Ghost Mode" during the build phase. In this mode, players can pass through any object (except map boundaries), making building easier.
